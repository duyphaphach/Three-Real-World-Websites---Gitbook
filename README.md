## Day 10: 26/08/2018

Some tips on front-end developments:

**Folder structure**

![](./Capture.PNG)

**Step to convert PSD to HTML and CSS**

- Build html files first.
- Inspect color, font size, spacing
- Convert font-size, color, spacing to CSS
- Add animation, effects

### Thoughts

- Add CSS to ensure color and spacing need 1 to 1 precision.

## Day 11: 29/08/2018

Config build tools and Steps to create skeleton HTML

* * *

**New folder structure**

![](./folder_structure.png)

**Note**:

The `index.js` in scripts folder should import style.less

The `style.less` should include banner, like:

/_ Open Charity style _/

* * *

**Tips on setting up Build tools**

Webpack

Should hash output filename after build to support auto clearing cache at client

Gulp

**Steps to install**

1. Create `gulp` folder and `gulpfile.js`
2. Install gulp `yarn add gulp --ignore-engines`
3. Install `require-dir`
4. Config `gulpfile.js`
  - gulp/util.js: for logging
  - gulp/concat.js: concat files
  - gulp/gulp-size.js: Alert file size after build

**Note**

Gulp's tasks naming:

For development: `scripts:vendor:compile`

For production: Add prefix `production`

* * *

**Create Skeleton HTML**

Prepare resource:

1. Open design file with Photoshop
2. Resize PSD file if it's too large using Image/Image Size...
3. Extract color, fonts and images and note down/save them

Connect resource to our project

**With fonts**

Always include all font type : oet, woff, ttf for cross-browser support

Suggest [fontsquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/) to generate font kit from one file type

The font kits from internet usually include demo document, use their css to quickly define fonts

**With color**

Use [chir.ag](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED) to name color and turn colors into `less` variables

Define color class for text and background

- Text: .text-&lt;color_name>
- Background: .bg-&lt;color_name>

**With image**

Rename them to describe where they would be used in website

Naming convention: Using \_ to separate words, \_\_ to represent child component

Ex: Image used for item 2 of section 2: `section_1__item_2.png`

* * *

Writting HTML

Name `class` and `id` right:

**With class**

Follow Semantics UI: `primary button`, `facebook item`, `facebook item-1`

**With ID**

Use \_ to separate words and ** to represent child components: \`footer**social_links\`

**Note**

- Class and ID should be used mixed.
- Classes are used for common styling, describing component
- IDs are used for quicker queries.
- Writing HTML should avoid over thinking

### Today's progress

Naming convention update

Front-end tips and tricks

Some strays on the modern web design world

Introduce some web optimization techniques

Introduce regression test

### Details

**Naming convention update**

Vocabularies:

Classes:

`.title` (For section, for card),

`.content`(For section),

`.meta`(Additional information, use with descriptive classes like `time`, `date`, `price`, `discount`, wrapped with `<span>`),

`.action`(For button),

`.thumbnail`

`.row > .column`,

`.list > li.item`

* * * 

**Front-end tips and tricks**

New rules:

1. Restrict on using `.container-fluid`, using `.container` and override `@container-md` ,`@container-sm`, `@container-sm`
2. Using css `class` for defining fonts
3. Color and background color class pattern: `color-[color-name]`, `background-[color-name]`
4. Bootstap `.row`s should be only applied to `.row > .column`s
5. Font's filename: `"Font-Name.[ext]"`
6. font-family define: `'Font Name'`
7. Using CSS over JS creating animations

Template structure:
